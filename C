### **Life of the Sultan of Cihangir**

In the year 1470, in the heart of the Ottoman Empire, a child was born in Amasya. This child was Yavuz Sultan Selim, who would change the fate of the Ottoman Empire. Selim spent his childhood years in the historical setting of Amasya. Under the supervision of his father, Sultan Bayezid II, he received military and administrative education. His leadership and military skills, demonstrated at a young age, were signs of his future greatness as a sultan.

Selim entered into a fierce struggle with his brothers to ascend the throne. This struggle was one of the most challenging periods in Ottoman history. With the abdication of his father, Bayezid II, Selim became the new sultan of the Ottoman Empire in 1512. His ascension to the throne was met with great enthusiasm among the people.

As sultan, Selim suppressed internal rebellions and restructured the state. Through his reforms, he strengthened the Ottoman Empire and expanded its borders. The suppression of internal rebellions and the restructuring of the state showcased Selim's leadership abilities and determination.

One of Selim's greatest achievements was his struggle with the Safavid State. By defeating the Safavid State in the Battle of Chaldiran, he solidified the Ottoman's dominance in the east. This victory secured the eastern borders of the Ottoman Empire and proved Selim's military genius.

The Egyptian Campaign was one of Selim's most significant expeditions. In this campaign, he destroyed the Mamluk State and incorporated Mecca and Medina into Ottoman territories. This success increased Selim's prestige in the Islamic world and reinforced the Ottoman Empire's religious leadership.

Selim's final years were marked by illness. However, the legacy he left behind shaped the future of the Ottoman Empire. In 1520, Yavuz Sultan Selim passed away. His son, Suleiman the Magnificent, succeeded him. Suleiman continued his father's legacy, elevating the Ottoman Empire to its zenith.

Yavuz Sultan Selim's legacy increased the power and splendor of the Ottoman Empire. Following in his footsteps, Suleiman the Magnificent expanded the empire's borders even further. Selim's reforms and military successes were crucial steps in shaping the future of the Ottoman Empire.
